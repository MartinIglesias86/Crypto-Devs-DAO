# App that interact with a Smart Contract to be part of the Crypto Devs DAO.

In this project I'm going to use [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to create an app to be part of the Crypto Devs DAO, with the deployment of the Smart Contract on
the Rinkeby test net.

## Requirements
* Anyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from an NFT marketplace
* Everyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can vote for or against the active proposals
* Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal
